# Algorithm-Evaluation
Some Evaluation method for Metaheuristic Algorithm


1. PCA : Using PCA to do Dimension Reduction and then record the 2D output data.
2. AutoCSV : Using AutoCSV to record CEC run result.
3. Diversity : Calculate performance of  diversity for each algorithm.




Gnuplot 
1. PCA/PCA_2D.plt : Compare several Algorithms and then show the 2D gif in different record points.
2. Diversity/Div_Histogram.plt : Make diversity histogram with different algorithms.
3. FLA/Contour_*.plt : First, use PCA to do dimension reduction. Second, use this 2D data to make contour.
   In folder FLA have some example output file.
