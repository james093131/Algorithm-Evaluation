# Algorithm-Evaluation
Some Evaluation method for Metaheuristic Algorithm


1. PCA: Using PCA to make Dimension Reduction and then record the 2D output data.
2. AutoCSV : Using AutoCSV to record CEC run result.
3. Diversity : Calculate the performance of diversity for each algorithm.




Gnuplot

PCA/PCA_2D.plt: Compare several Algorithms and then show the 2D gif in different record points.
Diversity/Div_Histogram.plt: Make diversity histogram with different algorithms.
FLA/Contour_*.plt: First, use PCA to make dimension reduction. Second, use this 2D data to make a contour. In the folder, FLA has some example output files.
